# Engineering Rules

- Use Go 1.26.
- Use `github.com/lithammer/shortuuid/v4` for new product IDs, with its default alphabet. IDs retain all 128 UUID bits; never truncate them or invent another alphabet. Treat IDs as opaque, case-sensitive strings. Keep provider-owned IDs in their provider's format.
- Store product IDs and references as text. Preserve existing ID strings and links; generate shortuuids only for new records. Security tokens still use cryptographically secure token generation.
- Write self-documenting code. Add comments only to explain non-obvious behavior, constraints or reasons the code cannot express; omit comments that narrate the code.
- Keep implementations and JSON minimal; every line and field must earn its place. Prefer correcting contracts and deleting duplication over adding branches or layers.

## Jaz design language

Linear is the reference and Jaz Tasks its in-house model; CRM and future products match both.

- Calm, dense work surfaces. Records set the hierarchy; no filler copy, explanatory paragraphs or decorative UI.
- Colour comes only from the tokens in `frontend/src/styles.css` (see `frontend/THEMING.md`): `bg` content, `panel` chrome, `raised` menus and dialogs, `ink`/`ink-2`/`ink-3` text, `border` hairlines, `primary` for selection and primary actions with white labels. Support light, dark and MCP host themes.
- Inter 13px for UI, 12px for secondary text, medium-weight headings, tabular figures for counts. Icons are 16px in `ink-2`.
- `--radius-control` (6px) for controls and rows, `--radius-card` (10px) for cards, menus and popovers. Separate surfaces by fill, not outlines; only floating layers get shadows.
- Actions use `Button` from `@jaz/ui/button`, the source package in Jaz Tasks `ui/`. Both products pin the same Git commit. Choose `variant` and `size`; callers add layout only. Keep form submission explicit with `type="submit"`; update the shared source instead of copying styles or adding another Button.
- Tasks' 232px sidebar, slim page headers, aligned table rows and short board cards. Create and edit in dialogs or contextual controls.
- Menus share `components/ui/menu.tsx`, `context-menu.tsx` and `dropdown-menu.tsx`, kept identical in every product: 32px rows of icon and label, `ink-3` shortcut hints where a shortcut exists, a filled ▸ on submenus, edge-to-edge separators. Group properties, then actions, then delete; delete stays neutral and confirms. Property submenus use `ContextMenuOptions`: a filter field, a check on the current value and number keys 1–9.
- Right-click menus repeat visible controls, never replace them. Hover and selection fills stay subtle; focus stays visible.
- Motion is 100–160ms on named properties, interruptible, and off under reduced motion. No bounce or load choreography.
- Inline MCP results fit their content; full app views keep navigation and record links.
- Verify UI in the real screen with realistic data, both themes and a narrow width, against Tasks and Linear.
